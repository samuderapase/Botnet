Our Botnet communicates over an IRC network, mostly using private chats between
the command and control bot and the slave bots. Our Botnet has a main CC bot that
is in control of the whole net and it mainly talks to the slave bots to give
commands that will be carried out. The CC talks to each bot individually instead
of all at once. The net also uses multi-part cryptography. This means that it
uses many different types of crypto. The Botnet uses RSA crypto to initialize the
communications between the CC and the bots. Once a connection is established, the
CC and the bots perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange and generate a secret key
that will be used in a triple DES block cipher for all messages. 

To build our code, you should run the make files that are on the system. To start
the slave bots, you run "make bots n", where n can be some number. To start the 
CC bot, you run "make master". To start a leasing bot, one that can lease from our
net, you run make leaseMaster.
